Hello - welcome to our project testing the confidence and accuracy of the Google Speech-to-Text API at different volumes!
There is a Colab notebook linked in the repository that contains everything you will need to recreate this project - audio files containing a recording at different volumes, Google Shell codes for inputing the recordings into the API, a Google Sheet with our final data, and a link to our Looker Studio dashboard. The Google Shell codes are including as screenshots, so they will have to manually be entered into and ran in the Shell Console.
